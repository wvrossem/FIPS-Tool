FIPS-Tool
==============

Project Overview
----------------

This repository is part of the project "An Extensible Framework for Indoor Positioning on Mobile Devices", which is the master thesis that I did in 2011-2012 at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel to achieve my "Master in Applied Computer Science". My promotor for this master thesis was [Prof. Dr. Beat Signer](http://www.beatsigner.com/). The thesis document can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j0xehv5qodxh3id/Van%20Rossem%20-%202012%20-%20A%20FrameWork%20for%20Indoor%20Positioning%20on%20Mobile%20Devices.pdf).

The entire project is divided into several repositories:

* [FIPS-Datastore](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Datastore)
* [FIPS-Server](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Server)
* [FIPS-Tool](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Tool)
* [FIPS-Android-Offline](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Android-Offline)
* [FIPS-Android-Online](https://github.com/wvrossem/FIPS-Android-Online)

Tool Usage
----------

This is a Java tool that facilitates the uploading data for the IPS and testing the available algorithms. It was created using [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) and [WindowBuilder](http://www.eclipse.org/windowbuilder/). The easiest way to run this tool is therefore to open it as a Eclipse WindowBuilder project and run it from there.

##### Testing algorithms on single measurements in the tool
